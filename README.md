# Video Engines

This repository contains precompiled binary engines such as `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` used by various applications developed by Pondok Algoritma.

These binaries are hosted here to enable automatic downloading by applications like:

- Vidura, Universal video downloader
- Narrify, is an AI-powered tool that turns text or dialogue into fully narrated videos. It combines realistic text-to-speech (TTS) voiceovers with automated video generation â€” perfect for education, storytelling, tutorials, and more.
- Other internal or public video-related tools
